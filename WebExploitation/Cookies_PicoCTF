-Played around in inspect while searching cookies like chocolate chip, or gingerbread
-Noticed that thier values were numbers and changed with each cookie
-Since the problem was called cookies i went to the cookies of the web page and changed the value of the request manually and refreshed the page
-It changed to the cookies that I knew so the flag had to be in there with some sort of value
-Did a search on intervals of 10 too see what was the maximum value.
-Then searched one by one and the flag appeared on the value 18
-Flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}

//how can i search it more efficiently?
