-Read the linux command 'strings' documentation
-Used it as:
  strings strings (the file's name is 'strings')
-It printed a bunch of information that was too hard to read
-Used a python script to try to get the flag:
    with open('/home/pierrevales-picoctf/strings', 'r') as file:
      for line in file:
        if line[0:5]=="pico":
          print(line)
-It cant decode the string
