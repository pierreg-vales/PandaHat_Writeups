-First connected to the ssh
  ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 54303
  with passeord: 481e7b14
-Once connected used ls to view the files
-Used cat on a file called 1of2.flag.txt
  it printed: picoCTF{xxsh_

-Used cat on a file called instructions-to-2of3.flag.txt
  it printed: Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`

-Used cd to move to / (root)
-Used ls to view the files here and found 2of3.flag.txt
  read it using cat: 0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_

-There was a file called instructions-to-3of3.flag.txt
-Read it and it had: Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
-So i moved to ~ (home) using cd
-Home had a file named 3of3.flag.txt
-Used cat to read it: 1118a9a4}

-Now we have all three parts of the flag
flag: picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_1118a9a4}
