-Used wget to get all three links (python script, password and encrypted flag)
-When you run the python script it shows ways in which you can decrypt a text file
-Ran:
    python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en (-d is to decrypt de flag)
-It asked for the password so I entered it and it printed the decrypted flag.
